Convolution
Extract info from the matrix by moving a filter/kernel arround the matrix, 


Filters/Kernels
Used to extract features from a matrix, should be odd sized to get the edges

Epochs
Once we run the model through test data we call it one epoch

1x1 Convolution
Taking a 1X1 matrix arround the input matrix and typically used to change the size of kernel 

3x3 Convolution
A 3X3 matrix is used to extra info and it is moved like a duster on the black board to extract info

Feature Maps
A collection of all the points where our feature is present, collecting all Es from the image 

Activation Function
Used to decide the values of function, should be active or in-active based on the convluted data

Receptive Field
In the next layer, how much info is present about pixels from the origional imageis called a recptive field, the last layer has global receptive field. And it should be atleast the size of the object
